This is a halloween party inviter! The purpose is to get people to our party on October 31st and have them bob for apples, etc.

## Getting Started

You'll need Ruby 2.1.0 installed, I'd recommend using `rvm` or `rbenv` if you need to install this version.

Once Ruby is installed, install bundler if it isn't with `gem install bundler`, then run `bundle install`.

To start the server, ruby `bundle exec ruby app.rb`.

To visit the site, open up a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
